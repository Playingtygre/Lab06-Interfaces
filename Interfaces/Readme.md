## Overview
So in my example I will be showing is about pokemon, each pokemon Character has is its own Class. Since interfaces allows for a method to be used across different classes, this is really important. Since the pokemon are need a parent class to gain methods from a hierarcy structure, Interfaces allow methods to be shared across different classes.
In my diagram, the attack swift if being utilized by three diffrent pokemon, swift is a method shared by these classes
